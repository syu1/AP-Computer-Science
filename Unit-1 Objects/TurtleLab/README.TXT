Purpose

The goal of this lab for you to experience what your first assignment as a
	software developer at a software company may be like. You will be working
	with a large body of code (Turtle and TurtleWorld) with which you are
	unfamiliar. You don't understand all of the intricacies of the existing
	code base and you aren't yet familiar with many of the Java language
	features that you will use. However, through experimentation and browsing
	the documentation, you will be able to complete this assignment and most
	likely go beyond the requirements!
